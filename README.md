## Thoughts
The task was extremely easy. The requirements for the 2nd task were quite vague. It is 
not possible to directly connect a raw javascript application to a database. To do so, you'd 
need a backend server that bridges the communication between the front and backend. The 
instructions were to keep it simple, so I opted to just locally store the saved values, instead 
of creating a backend server.

I also refrained from using fancy frameworks because of a difference in development environments, 
so I chose to just create a simple file.

## Task 2
- Run `npm install --save`

1. Open index.html
2. Run `node create_db.js`
3. Console will print confirmation message ('Database connection established!', 'Database created', 'Table created'
4. Enter field values and 'save'

##Task 3
- Naming a folder 'CON' is not allowed in Windows as it is a reserved name for the console device in CLIs
- I, alternately, named it 'Task 3'
